## Introduction

AI has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine by enabling faster diagnoses, more accurate predictions, and personalized treatments. This project delves into:
- Medical image analysis (e.g., X-ray, MRI scans)
- Predictive healthcare models (e.g., disease prediction, patient outcome forecasting)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for medical records analysis
- AI-driven drug discovery and development
- Precision medicine and treatment optimization

By utilizing AI, this project aims to bridge the gap between technological advancements and healthcare, promoting better patient care and outcomes.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-applications-in-Medicines.git
    cd AI-applications-in-Medicines
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once you have the project set up, you can start experimenting with the AI models and the provided datasets.

### Running the Notebooks
1. Launch a Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the notebook you wish to work with (e.g., `notebooks/image_classification.ipynb`).

### Running the Models
You can also run the models directly by executing the Python scripts in the `models/` directory:
```bash
python models/cnn_model.py
```

### Data Preprocessing
Before using the models, you may need to preprocess the data using the following script:
```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
```
